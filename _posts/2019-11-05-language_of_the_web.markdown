I have always loved learning languages.  Something about the symbolic use of words and their meanings, and then being able to use them to communicate with anyone.

The web is not that much different.  

I got into software engineering because we are increasingly becoming a digital world, and I wanted to learn the language of the web.  I also see this as a field that allows you to be creative, analytical, technical, and forward thinking at the same time.  

HTML and CSS were a lot of fun to learn.  JavaScript, where I am still in the intro phase, is more fun, interesting and intuitive than I thought it would be.  Coming from a very different work background, I had to change gears and develop a programming mindset.  Learning Ruby, a backend language, has been quite a challenge.  One of the things that keeps me engaged is finding out how things are broken down into their composite parts behind the interface that we see on our devices.  How all the gears are working together to create the information that is constantly changing before us.  And the wide community of software developers and students who collaborate to improve on what they know.

At the Flatiron School, you are given the chance to try an array of language and frameworks to give you a good understanding of what to expect as a future software developer.  I was really curious as to how this all comes together, and these past several months have been a great learning experience because I have seen how a lot these skills are coming together.

Being a student in the self-paced online program for Software Engineering is not easy, at times it can be difficult and frustrating - but it is also rewarding.  If this is something that you have been thinking about for a long time, I think that it is worth taking the plunge.  You can only add to your skillset and open your mind to the possibilities of what is out there.
